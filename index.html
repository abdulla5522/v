    A trip to Bordeaux, France opened the eyes of three U.S. teens in ways they hadn’t expected.

 <span>Often</span>      the world seems to be so homogenized. You find the same stores and chain restaurants in New York, Paris, Salzburg, Dubai and Hong Kong. But take three teens from three different cities in the United States and bring them to Europe for the first time, and it’s the contrasts they notice.

    Christopher “Breck” DuPaul, Shaila Diaz and Sophie Kapshtica are spending this year in Rennes, France as part of a program run by School Year Abroad, a News Decoder partner school. 
</p>

<p id="para3">
    As part of the program, they took a trip to Bordeaux, a city in the southwest of France, famed for its wine. DuPaul, whose home is in Cleveland in the U.S. state of Ohio, noted that just being able to take the time to travel to Bordeaux itself was a contrast to the educational systems of the two countries.
